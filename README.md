###  About Me

I'm currently learning backend development through the ALX Software Engineering program, where I’m mastering the foundations of Linux, automation, and efficient system design.

What drives me is more than just elegant code — it's the pursuit of real-world impact through **automation**, **security**, and **intelligent digital infrastructure**. I’m passionate about solving local problems through global ideas, and I approach every challenge with a mix of structure, creativity, and cultural context.

###  Vision: Building Africa's Digital Efficiency Layer

> “I believe Africa’s digital future will be shaped by systems that are both *smart* and *culturally authentic*.”

My goal is to become a **young entrepreneur** who builds tools that:
- Empower local tourism through intelligent event systems
- Automate everyday workflows for businesses and communities
- Enhance cybersecurity and ethical digital practices
- Bridge backend technology with real-world automation
